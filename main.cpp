 * \brief FuseToEuler shows how to incorporate Sebastian Madgwick's sensor
 * fusion library to fuse raw IMU gyroscope and accelerometer telemetry
 * from RealSense cameras.

 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * \par
 * Many RealSense cameras come with an embedded 6DOF Inertial Motion 
 * Unit (IMU) which measures rotation with a gyroscope and acceleration 
 * with an accelerometer. Unfortunately, with the exception of the 
 * RealSense T265 tracking camera, this data is unfused, meaning that the 
 * data from each is NOT used to compensate for noise in the other. For 
 * example, when used na√Øvely, the raw orientation data is affected by 
 * any camera motion because there is no inherent way for the sensor to 
 * know whether an applied force is from gravity or another motive force.
 * \par
 * Fusion algorithms "merge" the telemetry from independent sensor 
 * streams to create more stable  results.
 * \par
 * The Madgwick algorithm, named after Sebastian Madgwick who 
 * developed this algorithm in 2009, is one of the most popular ones. 
 * Fortunately for us, there is an open source library which implements 
 * this algorithm, ready to plunk into our code. In this tutorial, I will 
 * outline how to use it to derive the Euler orientation from the 
 * RealSense gyroscope and accelerometer data.
 * \par
 * I am programming in C/C++ on a Jetson AGX Xavier and using a 
 * RealSense L515 LiDAR camera.
 * \par
 * If you haven't set up `librealsense2` yet, please see this 
 * [tutorial](https://www.notion.so/How-to-install-librealsense-and-pylibrealsense-on-Jetson-5b909aeb1b6c409fb21464f2db869d41)
